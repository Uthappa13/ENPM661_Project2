# Project2_code

# Description
Project2_code implements the Dijkstra algorithm to find a path between the start and goal node. It makes use of priority queue to store the nodes to be visited and a dictionary to store the nodes that have been visited.

Code blocks are provided with comments which explains what those code do.

The code makes use of openCV and numpy libraries

# usage
The code can be run on VS code or any other code editor, input the initial state and goal state when prompted in the terminal.
The code computes the path and outputs a visualization of the nodes explored and the optimal path.
